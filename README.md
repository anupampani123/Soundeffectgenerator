# Soundeffectgenerator
Using AI ( encoder - decoder architecture) to produce sound effects which can be implemented as a plugin on Matlab

Code taken from Christian Steinmetz (link : https://www.christiansteinmetz.com/projects-blog/neuralreverberator) and he has a lot 
of the interesting projects as well.

For my project, I used IRs which pertain to immersive sounds. Other variations of the model include implementing a VAE.
